# cmsc434

This is the full Andriod Studio package for the Doodler App.

My source files are located in: ./CMSC434Doodler/app/src/main/java/com/example/mike/cmsc434doodler/

The two .java files in this directory are the code I had implemented for class on 11/3.

Online sources used include the Andriod Documentation, Jon Froehlich's Youtube tutorial's on custom views, and one Stack Overflow question regarding undo: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11114625/android-canvas-redo-and-undo-operation
